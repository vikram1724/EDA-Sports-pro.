###Abstract 

The field of sports analytics has undergone unprecedented and disruptive impacts brought by statistical learning and deep neural networks with boosted prediction power to model the complicated interactions within. Horse racing serves as an exemplary subfield for research as the involvement of both human and animal participants implies a higher level of complexity, which demands more systematic approaches of analysis and more sophisticated modelling techniques. This paper examines methods to predict the observable score, which refers to the finishing time of horses in horse racing events, and elaborates on the data collection stage, exploratory data analysis and predictive modelling techniques on the Japanese horse racing dataset. The modelling results indicate that dependent variable feature engineering results in more observable increase in prediction power rather than the choice of regression models to be fit on the dataset. Stacking methods applied on the regression models also prove to be ineffective. From the deep learning perspective, however, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) outperforms all the models and dissolves the effect of dependent variable feature engineering, which suggests that embracing deep neural networks could have significant improvement in prediction power for horse racing, and a similar modelling approach could be subsequently developed in other types of sports event.
